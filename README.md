## FIND ONE AND SKATE ()


  Introducing the Find One and Skate - a one-of-a-kind app designed specifically for skateboarders. Our app provides a comprehensive platform for the skateboarding community to discover, share, and connect. With an interactive map, users can search for the best skateboarding spots, view photos and videos of the spots uploaded by other users, and even add their own favorite spots to the map. By creating an account, users can not only contribute to the growth of the skateboarding community but also receive additional perks such as the ability to save their favorite spots, leave comments and reviews, and connect with other skateboarders. Our mission is to create a supportive and inclusive environment for skateboarders of all levels to connect, share their experiences, and progress their skills. With its innovative features and user-friendly design, the Skateboarding Spot Finder is set to revolutionize the way the skateboarding community discovers and interacts with each other.
  
## CREATORS
- Curtlen Aumiller
- Charles Lamb

## Tech Stack

- React
- Express
- Nodejs
- MongoDB
- MapBox
- BCryptjs
- Leaflet 

## User Flow
- For ease of use, we plan on using modals so user never has to navigate away from the map page just to fill out a form etc.  Images & videos will render to the side of the map as to not disrupt the discovery of new spots.
